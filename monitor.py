"""Singleton host monitor for the claude-toolkit container.

A std-lib `sched.scheduler` drives a time-ordered queue of `Event` objects. Each
event's `fire` does its work and re-arms itself (or schedules other events) on the
scheduler, so the queue never empties and the loop runs forever. Three recurring
events cover the jobs below; the monitoring event schedules a fresh CiWatchEvent
per request it discovers -- events adding events at runtime:
  1. Keep the read-only GitHub token fresh -- re-mint when the token file is older
     than ~50 min (installation tokens live ~60 min).
  2. Drain the pending-writes queue -- for each project that has pending writes and
     no drain already running, open a terminal tab (interactive `claude.py --write`,
     titled by project) to process it. One tab PER PROJECT, run concurrently, so
     several projects drain in parallel instead of waiting in a single line. Each
     project's drain is guarded by `docker ps` on its own
     `claude-toolkit-drain-<project>` container, so a restart cannot spawn a
     duplicate for a project already draining.
  3. Service the pending-monitoring queue -- each request (dispatched by `kind`;
     `ci` today) is a job to watch, e.g. a CI run armed by the arm_monitor push
     hook. Poll it to a terminal state, then hand the result back as a
     `ci-status-*` file in pending-reads for the read-only agent to react to.
     Requests are claimed into memory on first sight, so deleting the request file
     mid-watch cannot abort it; pending-monitoring also doubles as durable state,
     so a restart re-scans it and resumes. GitHub is polled with the host's own gh
     credentials (not the container's read-only token), so Actions/checks are
     readable.

One instance runs at a time: on startup a new monitor supersedes any running
one (SIGTERMs the incumbent via the PID file, then claims it), so a relaunch
always picks up the newest code. Started detached by claude.py; runs until
killed:
    kill "$(cat ~/.config/claude-toolkit/monitor.pid)"

Host-only (mints tokens, opens GUI terminal tabs); never runs inside a container.
