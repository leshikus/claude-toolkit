"""Session-start orientation for the claude-toolkit container.

Wired as a Claude Code ``SessionStart`` hook by ``run.py`` (the hook
is part of the container's inline settings, so it applies only inside the
toolkit container -- not to host sessions). The harness runs this at the start
of every session and injects its stdout into the model's context, so the "on
start" orientation happens deterministically instead of relying on the model to
remember it.

When the current branch is found, it runs ``gh pr view`` to report the related
pull request's progress (CI/check status, review decision, unresolved review
threads, mergeability) and asks the assistant to set its session goal to
completing that pull request. It highlights **unanswered reviewer comments** --
unresolved threads whose latest comment is from someone other than the PR author,
i.e. the ones awaiting your reply. When
the repo is a fork the PR is opened against the upstream parent with the branch
as head, so the lookup falls back to searching the parent. New orientation steps
can be added as further blocks in ``main``.

The full orientation text is both printed (the harness injects stdout into the
model's context) and written to ``.claude/start-session.md`` so a human can open
that file to read the outstanding review comments directly.
