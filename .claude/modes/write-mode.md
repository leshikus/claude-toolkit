# Write Mode — Processing Pending Writes

This describes the **write-capable agent** that drains the `~/.config/claude-toolkit/pending-writes/` hand-off queue produced by read-only sessions (see `read-only-mode.md` for how those files are authored and for the queue format). Each pending write is one atomic file in that format: a `Context`, a `Commands` block, and optionally a `Payload` block.

## Executing pending writes

When executing pending writes, first give Alexei a short summary of the pending operations (what each file does) before running any commands.

For each new pending-writes item, in order:

1. **Confirm** — summarize the operation for Alexei and get confirmation before acting.
2. **Safety check** — arm a parallel agent to check whether the action is safe to perform. Wait for that check to pass; if it flags the action as unsafe, do not execute — surface the concern to Alexei instead.
3. **Contents review** — review the *contents the write will produce*, not just that the command is well-formed. The read-only agent that queued it could not run code, post to GitHub, or see CI, so it may have made a wrong call; verify the substance:
   - **If it pushes code** (a commit or push): review the actual diff/code being committed. Is it correct, does it do what the file's `Context` claims, and does it introduce no obvious bug, regression, or unintended change? For a fix addressing a review comment, confirm the change actually resolves the reviewer's point. For **any** push, review all new code the push introduces relative to the remote tip — read the full diff of every new commit, not just a `--stat` summary or file list. This holds regardless of how the task file frames the write: a re-sign, a rebase, or a "clean fast-forward" whose tree is claimed identical to some prior commit is still new code arriving on the remote, so review it as such rather than trusting the `Context`'s characterization.
   - **If it posts a comment or review reply**: review whether the reply genuinely answers the review comment it responds to — does it address the reviewer's actual point, and is it factually accurate (e.g. it claims a change was made that really was made)?
   - For other operations (PR body, label, dispatch), sanity-check that the payload matches the stated intent.

   Proceed only once the contents review passes. If the contents are wrong or incomplete, do not execute — instead **request changes** (see below) so the read-only agent that queued it can fix and re-submit.

Then, each task file ends in one of three outcomes:

- **On error-less completion:** delete the file — successful completion removes it from the queue.
- **On failure** (a command errored while executing): keep the file, append a `Status: failed <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` line with the error, and do not delete it.
- **On changes requested** (the contents review rejected it before executing): do not run the commands; hand it back for revision as described next.

## Requesting changes (`changes_requested`)

The queue is a two-directory handshake:

- `~/.config/claude-toolkit/pending-writes/` — read-only agent → write agent (writes to execute).
- `~/.config/claude-toolkit/change-requests/` — write agent → read-only agent (review verdicts to resolve).

When the contents review finds the write is wrong or incomplete, do not execute it and do not silently fix it yourself. Replace the write request with a **change request** so the read-only agent that has the task context reworks it:

1. Create a file in `~/.config/claude-toolkit/change-requests/` named after the original request (`<original-file-name>.md` — the directory conveys that it is a change request, so no name prefix is needed).
2. That file must contain **the entire original request file verbatim**, followed by a `Changes requested` section that states, specifically, what is wrong and what must change — quote the offending diff/reply text and the reviewer's point it fails to address, so the read-only agent can act without re-deriving context.
3. Delete the original file from `pending-writes/` — the change-request file carries the full original, so nothing is lost.

Beyond a failed contents review, convert a pending write into a change request — a **clarification change request** — in two more cases, even when its commands are well-formed:

- **Unrelated to the project.** The write does not belong to the project whose queue you drain (e.g. it targets a different repository, PR, or checkout than this queue's `<project>` subfolder). Do not execute it; hand it back as a clarification change request naming the project it appears to belong to, so the read-only agent re-files it under the correct queue.
- **Stalled.** The write cannot make progress — it is gated on a dependency that never arrives, references a path/file/commit that does not exist here, or has been superseded by later work. Do not execute it; hand it back as a clarification change request describing what blocks it and what the read-only agent must supply or decide.

A clarification change request uses the same format and directory as above (the full original verbatim, followed by a `Changes requested` section that here poses the clarifying question), and likewise removes the original from `pending-writes/`.

Do not execute a change request yourself; it is the read-only agent's job to resolve it (see `read-only-mode.md`). Files under `change-requests/` are never run as commands — they are review verdicts, not writes.

After the writes succeed, check whether any CI monitoring should be launched. If an executed command pushed commits to a branch that triggers CI, or dispatched a workflow run, arm a background CI monitor for the resulting run (following the CI-monitoring guidance in `read-only-mode.md` — drive it with `/loop` so it survives relaunch), so the run is followed to its conclusion instead of dropped.

## Continuous monitoring

Continuously monitor the `~/.config/claude-toolkit/pending-writes/` directory. When a new task file appears, start processing it right away following the rules above (summarize for Alexei, safety-check, contents-review, then execute-and-delete, mark failed, or request changes). Do not wait to be asked — as soon as a new pending write shows up, pick it up and process it. (You do not consume `change-requests/`; that is the read-only agent's queue to resolve.)

Also check the queue whenever you finish a piece of work: as soon as any task completes, immediately re-scan `~/.config/claude-toolkit/pending-writes/` and report any pending writes to Alexei before moving on.
