"""Launch Claude Code in Docker with the current directory mounted, in auto mode.

    ./claude.py [claude args...]

The working session runs with the host's real GitHub token and
`--permission-mode auto`: it works autonomously (no routine permission prompts)
while Claude Code's auto-mode classifier gates dangerous actions (force push,
exfiltration, production deploys, routing around a review). Routine pushes and PR
creation flow directly, so CI starts as soon as a push lands.

Our runtime state (gh config, api key, per-project queues, writes log) and toolkit
code (hooks, mode docs) live under ~/.config/claude-toolkit/ and are mounted into
the container. The host's own ~/.claude is mounted as-is, so the session runs in
the user's real Claude environment (their CLAUDE.md, skills, plugins, history);
our behavior is layered on via --settings (hooks) and --append-system-prompt.

Two hooks observe the session (they never gate it): capture_writes logs every
remote write to the global writes log (~/.config/claude-toolkit/writes-log/) for a
separate --review session to analyze after the fact, and arm_monitor arms the host
monitor's CI watch after a successful push. The host monitor also watches open PRs.
