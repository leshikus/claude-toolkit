Our runtime state (queue, tokens, gh config, keyring copy) and toolkit code
(hooks, mode docs) live under ~/.config/claude-toolkit/ and are mounted into the
container. The host's own ~/.claude is mounted as-is, so the session runs in the
user's real Claude environment (their CLAUDE.md, skills, plugins, history); our
sandbox behavior is layered on via --settings (hooks) and --append-system-prompt.

Read-only (default): a PreToolUse hook queues GitHub writes to
~/.config/claude-toolkit/project/pending-writes instead of running them, and the
GitHub token is a scoped read-only App token kept fresh by a background refresher.

--write: extract the host's real gh token (from the login keychain via
`gh auth token`) into a generated hosts.yml + token file, mount those into the
container, and leave the queue hook inactive -- so the session executes GitHub
writes directly, used to drain the pending-writes queue.
