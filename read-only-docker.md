# Read-Only Mode (Docker)

If the current session is in read-only mode, do not create PRs, push commits, edit PR titles/bodies, or post comments/reviews/review-comment replies to GitHub directly.

Instead, create one atomic file per operation in the `~/.claude/pending-writes/` directory (named `<current-dir-name>-<short-slug>.md`, where `<current-dir-name>` is the basename of the working directory the operation relates to — e.g. `createrelease`), following the queue format below. Each file has the exact command(s) to run and any payload text (PR body, comment/reply text) the command consumes. A separate write-capable agent reads each pending file, executes its commands, and deletes it on success.

Create new files only — never edit or delete existing files.

After queuing a pending write, do not block on it: keep working on the rest of the task. Continuously monitor `~/.claude/pending-writes/` for the files you queued — a write-capable agent removes each file once it completes (or appends a `Status: failed` line on failure). When your queued write disappears, treat the operation as done and continue; if it gains a `Status: failed` line, surface the failure to Alexei. Never delete or edit your own queued files to "unblock" yourself.

## Queue format

The `~/.claude/pending-writes/` directory is a hand-off queue between a **read-only agent** (which cannot perform write operations) and a **write-capable agent** (which executes them). Each pending write is **one atomic file**.

Create one file per operation, named `<current-dir-name>-<short-slug>.md`, where `<current-dir-name>` is the basename of the current working directory (e.g. `createrelease`). Do not use a date/time stamp — pick a distinct `<short-slug>` per operation so files never collide:

    ### <current-dir-name> — <short title>
    Context: <why this is needed; link to PR/issue/review comment if any>

    Commands:
    ```bash
    <exact command(s) to run, ready to copy-paste>
    ```

    Payload (if the command reads text from a file/stdin, put it here verbatim):
    ```
    <PR body, comment text, review reply, etc.>
    ```

Rules:

- Read-only agents: **create new files only**; never edit or delete existing files.
- Keep commands exact and self-contained (include `--repo`, full URLs, etc.) so the executing agent needs no extra context.
- Put any multi-line text a command consumes (PR body, comment) in the Payload block and have the command read it from there, so quoting is unambiguous.

## Executing pending writes

When acting as the write-capable agent executing pending writes, first give Alexei a short summary of the pending operations (what each file does) before running any commands.

When a new pending-writes item appears, arm a parallel agent to check whether the required action is safe before executing it. Wait for that safety check to pass; if it flags the action as unsafe, do not execute — surface the concern to Alexei instead.

Then, for each task file:

- **On error-less completion:** delete the file — successful completion removes it from the queue.
- **On failure:** keep the file, append a `Status: failed <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` line with the error, and do not delete it.

After the writes succeed, check whether any CI monitoring should be launched. If an executed command pushed commits to a branch that triggers CI, or dispatched a workflow run, arm a background CI monitor for the resulting run (per the CI monitoring rule), so the run is followed to its conclusion instead of dropped.

## CI monitoring

When a read-only session needs to follow a CI run to its conclusion (e.g. after queuing a push or a `can be tested` label that triggers CI):

- **Drive it with `/loop`, not a one-shot background poll.** A `/loop` (self-paced, or with an interval) survives across turns and re-enters on each tick, so the run is followed even after context is summarized or the session is relaunched — a plain `run_in_background` poll dies on relaunch and drops the run.
- **Post a timestamped progress update to the console on every tick.** Include the UTC time and the current job states, e.g. `[04:50Z] ClickBench amd=in_progress arm=queued`.
- **Update in place instead of scrolling.** Where the terminal allows it, rewrite the same status line with a carriage return (`\r` / `^M`) rather than printing a fresh line each tick, so the console shows one live-updating line. This also surfaces the current status in the terminal tab title, giving at-a-glance progress without reading the log.
- Keep the tick interval sane (poll every few minutes, not seconds) and stop the loop once every watched job reaches a terminal state, then report the outcome.

## Continuous monitoring

Continuously monitor the `~/.claude/pending-writes/` directory. When a new task file appears, start processing it right away following the rules above (summarize for Alexei, execute, delete on success). Do not wait to be asked — as soon as a new pending write shows up, pick it up and process it.

Also check the queue whenever you finish a piece of work: as soon as any task completes, immediately re-scan `~/.claude/pending-writes/` and report any pending writes to Alexei before moving on.
